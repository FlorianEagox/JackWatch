# Jack Watch

A program designed to make the JackBox Party Pack more accessible to blind players!

## Why?

I'd like to host blind game nights in our discord server, and Jackbox is nearly a perfect game. However, some events happen on the hosts's screen which aren't announced to players audibly, So I'm creating a program that will make callouts to make many jackbox games playable without vision.

## How?

The program will simply watch the screen via OCR and detect callouts it needs to make for each game, then announce them over TTS.

## Current supported games:

    - Quiplash 3 -- In Progress
